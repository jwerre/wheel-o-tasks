# Wheel-O-Tasks!

My kids are too young for full blown chores like cleaning the bathroom or mowing the lawn but I wanted to prepare now them with smaller tasks. I made The Wheel-O-Tasks to make it fun! We spin it every morning while I'm making breakfast and my kids actually love it. We've been doing it for months now and they still look forward to doing it every morning. This is a great way to keep you children occupied for a short time and gives them satisfaction of helping out around the house.


## How to change the tasks:

To change the task open the file at `js/main.js` and find the line that begins with `const TASKS
 = ` around line 20. You can move or modify any of the tasks in this list to suite your own household.
